I love maps. During my year-long trip in New Zealand, i looked at the map everyday, reminiscing the road crossed, searching where to go next. 

Everywhere I go, I could not resist taking some short videos of the scenery as I feel photos alone just could not do the place justice. And we often traveled extra miles to explore hidden gems/ less traveled in the country. One of our project is a sand project where we took a small sample of the sand in the country's beach and store in a tiny glass bottle, as we were fascinated with the vast array of sand colours in different beaches around the country.

With the large amount of short videos of different unique locations taken along the trip, I wanted to do a showcase of my road traveled. While a simple video compilation would not be the best option in serving such purpose, other ways were exploited.

And I particularly like the function of my iPhone album where it displays the photos/ videos I took on a map in corresponding places. If the function allows, I would like to let my family/ friends browse my collection through the map. It does not only show how broadly I traveled through the country, it depicts the beauty of distinctive locations on the vast land.

So one day I came up with this idea that I upload the video to youtube with its coordinates in the description box, then I collaborated with ChatGPT in accomplishing the mission where I can mimic the Apple Photo Map on a website so more people can virtually visit the places I have been to, sharing the beauty of Aotearoa. 

Wondering which coast/ beaches are the best? Why not take a look yourself? By Navigating around the map and click on the pin, you can easily experience the country's wonders virtually or even plan a trip visiting this breathtaking place.
